# Jetpack Compose Playground

Over the course of the last few years Android development has gone through significant changes in how we structure our apps, the language we use for development, the tooling & libraries that help us speed up our  
development and the improvements in testing our apps. What had not changed in all these years is the Android UI toolkit. This changes with Jetpack Compose that aims to re-imagine what Android UI development would look  
like using declarative programming principles. It is heavily influenced by existing web and mobile frameworks such as React, Litho, Vue & Flutter and would be a paradigm shift in Android UI development as we know it.

This repository aims to show the Jetpack Compose way of building common Android UI that we are accustomed to building.
