# Jetpack Compose Playground

Over the course of the last few years Android development has gone
through significant changes in how we structure our apps, the language
we use for development, the tooling & libraries that help us speed up
our development and the improvements in testing our apps. What had not
changed in all these years is the Android UI toolkit. This changes with
Jetpack Compose that aims to re-imagine what Android UI development
would look like using declarative programming principles. It is heavily
influenced by existing web and mobile frameworks such as React, Litho,
Vue & Flutter and would be a paradigm shift in Android UI development as
we know it.

This repository aims to show the Jetpack Compose way of building common
Android UI that we are accustomed to building.
