// Android Studio lets you preview your composable functions within the IDE itself, instead of

// The main restriction is, the composable function must not take any parameters. If your composable
// function requires a parameter, you can simply wrap your component inside another composable
// function that doesn't take any parameters and call your composable function with the appropriate
// params. Also, don't forget to annotate it with @Preview & @Composable annotations.
